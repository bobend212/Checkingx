<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A README file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file. There are many great README templates available on GitHub, but I think that this README template is so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
